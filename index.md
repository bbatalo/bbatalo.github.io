# Bojan Batalo

e-mail: <bbatalo@hotmail.com>

Postdoctoral researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ([AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html)). I am a part of Machine Learning Research Team ([MLRT](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/mlrt/)).

My research interests include the application of subspace/manifold-based methods to pattern recognition problems and simulation calibration. I'm fond of exploring different topics, and have done work on natural language processing, linguistics and the language of science communication, sound classification and cybersecurity.
