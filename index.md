# Bojan Batalo

e-mail: bbatalo@hotmail.com

I am a PhD student at the Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab), University of Tsukuba ([CVLab](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/), and technical staff in the Machine Learning Research Team (MLRT) [MLRT](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/mlrt/), part of the Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ([AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html).

My main research topic involves applying subspace/manifold-based methods to pattern recognition problems. I'm fond of exploring different topics, and have done work on natural language processing, linguistics, sound classification and other stuff.
