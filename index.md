# Bojan Batalo

e-mail: <bbatalo@hotmail.com>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ([AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html)). I am a part of Machine Learning Research Team ([MLRT](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/mlrt/)).

My main research topic involves applying subspace/manifold-based methods to pattern recognition problems. I'm fond of exploring different topics, and have done work on natural language processing, linguistics, sound classification and other stuff.
